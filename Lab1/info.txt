Q2 bunny.py
	States -> states in this question are rather tricky to define. I define them as C * D where C is the count and D is the direction(check the code). These states are internal to the agent a.k.a bunny.

	Precepts -> percept is just a signal indicating that whether the bunny is currently on water or land.

	Actions -> action is to move either right or left depending on the state.

	Strategy -> to cover the full 2D line the best possible way is to go back and forth, each time increasing your distance by 1 in each direction until you see a land.

Q3 vacummrobo.py
	States -> each position in the 2D space is a state.

	Precepts -> whether there is dirt or not at the current position.

	Actions -> Moving on the next position

	Strategy -> to cover the entire 2D space in a spiral fashion, until all the dirt is picked up.

Q4 countwords.py
	States -> 3 states, marked by agent.previous - 
				1) start state
				2) state which represents that the last read was a blank space
				3) state which represents that the last read was not a space
	Precepts -> Current read character.

	Action -> To increment the count or not.

	Strategy -> If a space is encountered after reading a character then increment the count. Change the previous read character at the end each time.
