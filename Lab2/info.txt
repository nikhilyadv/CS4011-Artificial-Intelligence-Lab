dummymaps.py -
	IDEA -> idea is to first mark all the cars with a index (according which they start their journey), and process each car when it reaches a node. To do this I maintained a min priority queue whose weight is time to next node. I initaize this queue with initial times of arrival of the cars. I maintian the number of cars on a given road at any time in a 2D matrix.Then a pop the cars one by one increment and decrement the number of cars in the matrix of the new road and previous road respectively. I then use this matrix to calculate the car's speed by the given formula(I have the number of cars in the 2D matrix). Then I calculate the time it will take to reach the next node. Then I again insert it in the queue and then pop the next car. I do this until the queue is empty i.e when all cars have reached their destination.
