PLEASE USE PYTHON 3

1.py ->
		This program uses simple A* search. Heuristic is chosen to be Euclidean distance.
2.py -> 
		Here at every possible path in my search i have two options either to take the bus or to take cycle (thought there is a limit on distance > 3). I take both the options and then evaluate the best one.
