n2-1.py
	input files is in.txt. use python n2-1.py <in.txt
	In this program I have implemented a simple and standard bfs search.
	I must warn that it might not work for some configuration as it as a program has space limitations etc.
	I used a queue to store the current state and used a dictionary to hash the state so that I maintain a visited array.
